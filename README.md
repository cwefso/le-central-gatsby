## Project Overview
  One of my favorite restaurants that no longer exists is Denver's Le Central. I made this mock business page for them because of the special place they hold in my heart and stomach. 
  
  This page is built with React, but the interesting part is the Strapi backend (https://github.com/cwefso/le-central-backend). This admin panel allows the restaurant owner to simply add a new daily special with no knowledge of JavaScript, and see the page dynamically rerender with the new information.

  Upon loading the application, our user will see the most recent special and be able to see a menu and an about page.

  This interface allows an admin to update the backend endpoints with no knowledge of the code that is working behind the scenes.

  Once the admin has added a new special, that will appear on the page automatically.

Future plans:

- Testing with Cypress
- Fully updatable Menu
- Endpoints for Hours/Greeting
