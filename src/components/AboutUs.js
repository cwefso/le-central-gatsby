				Le Central has been giving Denver a sit-down history lesson on the
				breadth of French cuisine -- from the haute to the basse -- since 1981.
				Over the years, chefs and cooks from far-flung locales have passed
				through this kitchen, but owner Robert Tournier has always kept a close
				eye on the proceedings. At dinner, Le Central can be one of the city's
				most romantic spots, and for a relative pittance you can have feuillet√©
				d'escargot or one of a number of mussel preparations. At lunch, the
				restaurant is more casual, but still a good spot to linger over your
				meal. Check out the prix fixe menus, such as the lobster prix fixe for
				just $36.
